# 🔄 Case Study: Agile Transformation at ALPHA – Building Product Discipline from the Ground Up

## 📌 Overview  
When I joined ALPHA, the company had no formal agile processes in place — no defined sprints, no roadmaps, no ceremonies, and no product documentation. Engineering and data teams worked in silos, and stakeholders lacked visibility into progress.

I led a company-wide initiative to introduce **Scrum practices**, create a **centralized product roadmap**, and implement clear **product documentation standards** — driving structure, alignment, and stakeholder trust across the organization.

---

## 🎯 Goal  
To establish agile ways of working and bring product development under a visible, trackable, and collaborative process.

---

## 👨‍💻 My Role  
**Product Manager – ALPHA Augmented**  
- Introduced Scrum from scratch across 4 cross-functional squads  
- Facilitated sprint ceremonies (planning, standups, demos, retrospectives)  
- Created and owned the product roadmap across data, dashboard, and optimization teams  
- Led documentation standardization: epics, user stories, success criteria, demo notes  
- Acted as a bridge between business stakeholders and tech teams

---

## 🧩 Challenges  
- No ceremonies, no shared sprint planning, no backlog ownership  
- Scattered communication between business and tech teams  
- No visibility for leadership on delivery velocity or outcomes  
- Roadmaps were inconsistent or outdated, creating dependency chaos

---

## 🚀 Solution  
I established a full agile framework with the following pillars:

| Transformation Area      | Action Taken                                                  |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🧭 Product Roadmapping    | Centralized view by team, tied to quarterly goals             |
| 📅 Scrum Ceremonies       | Planning, standups, retros, demos standardized across teams   |
| 📋 Product Documentation  | Introduced epic > story > acceptance template across tools    |
| 🧪 Sprint Demo Culture     | Created a cadence of stakeholder demos every 2 weeks          |
| 📊 Progress Visibility     | Synced Notion, Jira, and stakeholder updates into a single source |

---

## 🎯 Key Highlights
- ✅ **First sprint demo** showcased tangible outputs to leadership — now a recurring biweekly ceremony  
- ✅ **Roadmap adoption** enabled alignment between product, engineering, and management  
- ✅ **Backlog grooming culture** improved scope clarity, reduced blockers, and improved velocity  
- ✅ **Documentation structure** gave the company a reusable framework for all new initiatives

## 📊 Impact

## 🧠 Lessons Learned  
- Starting agile from scratch requires **education, empathy, and persistence**  
- Sprint demos are **the fastest way to earn trust**
