# 💼 Case Study: Investment Onboarding Platform for HNW Clients

## 📌 Overview  
Wealth management firms face a high-touch, compliance-heavy onboarding process for high-net-worth (HNW) clients. Manual KYC, risk profiling, and documentation slowed conversions and burdened operations. I led the delivery of a **multi-region digital onboarding platform** that streamlined client journeys while ensuring compliance across multiple jurisdictions.

---

## 🎯 Goal  
To reduce onboarding time, increase self-service adoption, and improve user experience for HNW clients by digitizing and automating key onboarding steps — while ensuring compliance across GCC and Swiss markets.

## 🧩 Problem  
Manual onboarding took up to **7–10 business days**, with clients submitting scanned documents, filling paper-based risk forms, and going through disjointed communication touchpoints.  
Additionally, each jurisdiction (GCC vs Switzerland) had unique onboarding requirements, regulatory flows, and risk flags.
