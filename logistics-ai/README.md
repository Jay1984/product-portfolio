### 📦 OptiShip & CO₂ Dashboard  
**🎯 Role:** Product Manager – Data Products  
**📆 Duration:** Feb 2023 – Present  
**👥 Team:** 1 PM · 4 Engineers · 2 Analysts · 1 Designer  
**🛠 Tools:** Power BI · PostgreSQL · SeaRoutes API · Google Maps API · Azure Data Factory  

**🔍 Problem**  
Global clients needed visibility into emissions impact and shipment efficiency. There was no centralized view to track CO₂ savings, freight spend, or missed optimization opportunities across air and ocean lanes.

**🧠 Your Role**  
- Led product discovery and user interviews with logistics leads  
- Defined CO₂ KPI logic and anomaly thresholds  
- Designed drill-down Power BI dashboards with stakeholder input  
- Coordinated data ingestion from freight forwarders into PostgreSQL warehouse  
- Integrated SeaRoutes API to estimate emissions across multi-leg shipments

**🚀 Solution**  
Delivered an interactive dashboard with:  
✅ Heatmaps for CO₂ and cost savings by route, mode, and consignee  
✅ Baseline vs optimized comparison using tonne-km and radiative forcing  
✅ Monthly emissions report PDF generator + anomaly detection logic  
✅ Drill-down views on missed optimization and mode split improvements

**📊 Impact**  
- 🌱 Identified **double-digit CO₂ savings opportunities** across 20+ lanes  
- 📉 Reduced unnecessary air freight through visibility  
- 📊 Increased client confidence and recurring reporting adoption

### ✈️ WD Shipment Consolidation (Thailand to US)  
**🎯 Role:** Product Manager – Logistics Optimization  
**📆 Duration:** Apr 2024 – Jul 2024  
**👥 Team:** 1 PM · 2 Data Analysts · 1 Ops Lead  
**🛠 Tools:** Excel · SQL · Google Maps API · Freight Forwarder Data  

**🔍 Problem**  
Western Digital shipped air freight daily from Thailand to US customers, leading to high costs and poor truck utilization. They needed to evaluate whether consolidating shipments twice a week could maintain on-time delivery.

**🧠 Your Role**  
- Designed the proof-of-concept study and analysis scope  
- Mapped delivery addresses to 3 U.S. hub airports (LAX, ORD, MIA)  
- Analyzed buffer days, freight forwarder capacity, and transit logic  
- Collaborated with ops and account teams for feasibility validation

**🚀 Solution**  
Built a weekly simulation model and visualization to:  
✅ Simulate delivery times with different shipment frequencies  
✅ Identify risk zones for late delivery  
✅ Align consolidation potential with client and carrier constraints

**📊 Impact**  
- 📦 Demonstrated feasibility of **twice-weekly shipping** without SLA breach  
- 💰 Highlighted cost-saving potential in excess of **$200K/year**  
- 🧭 Informed client roadmap for global consolidation rollout
